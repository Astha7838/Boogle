NOTE: Drexel cisco VPN should be connected .

B. STEPS TO DEPLOY ON HEROKU:

Currently, the usage of the Drexel account would require VPN, Cisco to be specific, in order to access the provided TUX URL. This would work in a local environment, but upon deployment, the URL would not be accessible because of the lack of VPN. Therefore, we can create a personal trial account, valid only for 15 days, in order to make use of ElasticSearch.
